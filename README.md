Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning repository! This project is dedicated to exploring and implementing various machine learning algorithms, techniques, and models. The goal is to provide clear, well-documented code examples and hands-on experience with different machine learning approaches.

Features
Supervised Learning: Implementations of classification and regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVMs, etc.)
Unsupervised Learning: Clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection techniques (e.g., K-Means, PCA, DBSCAN)
Neural Networks: Basics of deep learning models, including feed-forward neural networks and convolutional networks (CNNs).
Model Evaluation: Tools for model evaluation, including cross-validation, accuracy metrics, confusion matrix, etc.
Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: Data cleaning, scaling, encoding, and feature selection.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras (for deep learning), matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/MFahadHussain/machine-learning.git
Install the necessary dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Explore the examples folder for working code snippets and models. Each example is well-commented to help you understand the underlying concepts.

Feel free to contribute with your ideas, enhancements, or new machine learning techniques. If you find any bugs or have questions, donâ€™t hesitate to open an issue!
